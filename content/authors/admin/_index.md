I'm a PhD candidate at the University of Auckland in Aotearoa New Zealand. I'm interested in a diverse range of topics in biology, such as: entomology, insects as food and feed, taxonomy, sexual selection and developmental plasticity. My masters thesis investigated allometry in sexually selected traits of *Hermetia illucens*, the black soldier fly. My PhD thesis is investigating insects as food in Aoteroa and focuses on public perceptions of insects as food, the reproductive biology of an endemic cerambycid beetle, *Prionoplus reticularis*, and, sexually selected traits in scramble competitions.
